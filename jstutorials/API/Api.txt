### ------------------------------------- API -----------------------

API is a communication language between two systems.
It can be between frontend and backend, or our frontend and backend. 
Or the backend could be someone else's, with our frontend, 
or both frontend and backend could belong to someone else. 
For example, one system could be written in Java and another in JavaScript,
or one in Ruby and the other in PHP. The medium through which these two systems 
communicate is called an API.

**Example:**
- GitHub API: [https://api.github.com/users/khojwar](https://api.github.com/users/khojwar)

**Other APIs:**
- [https://randomuser.me/](https://randomuser.me/)
